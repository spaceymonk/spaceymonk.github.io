Hello, everyone!

After spending some time with RL, I got a better understanding on Q-learning. Therefore, I have rewritten a solution to
the GridWorld problem.

But difference from the previous article is that I did not waste time to generalize the program or create an animation.
Just plain (and more accurate) calculations only using `numpy`. Also it is more descriptive.

It is again in the form of Jupyter Notebook. In the last cell I have included a "history browser" to keep track of the
changes made by the algorithm. I hope you will find it useful.

Oh, and one last thing: I am attaching a PDF file of empty Q table of the default Grid World example. So, if you want to
solve it yourselves it will help a lot (it did to me, _but I got bored in the half of the first iteration_). You can use
it as you like.

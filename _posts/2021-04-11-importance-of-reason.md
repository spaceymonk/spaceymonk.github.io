Hi everyone,

I created a [new repository](https://github.com/spaceymonk/Finance) on my GitHub
page about financial algorithms. I will upload new algroithms / researches to
this repository.

So far, I wrote a small Jupyter Notebook about importance of stop-loss in trading.  
[Here is the link](https://github.com/spaceymonk/Finance/blob/main/stop-loss.ipynb).

The notebook is self explanatory, so I will not write the details in here.  
Feel free to adjust the parameters and use other stocks data.

Hello everyone, 

I have started my graduation project this semester and I had decided to use JS for development.
Therefore, I thought it may be a good idea to freshen up my knowledge about NodeJS environment.

So, I am presenting to you my notes about the things that I found interesting, important and easy to forget in NodeJS
environment. I have mainly used the official documentation of NodeJS, but in some topics such as Callbacks and Event
Loop I have used MDN, StackOverflow and the refences in the documantation.

One final note, I have prepared this material for myself. So, you might find some parts to be superficial or redundant.
